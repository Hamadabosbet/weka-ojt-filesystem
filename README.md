# Web File Storage System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a secure web-based file storage system that allows users to upload, download, and manage their files. The application will be implemented in Python using the Flask framework, and it will utilize MySQL for storing user data and file information. The project involves the creation of RESTful APIs, implementing security measures, and providing a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

### 1. File Upload & Download

1.1 Users can upload files to the system.
1.2 Uploaded files are stored securely.
1.3 Users can view a list of their uploaded files and download them.
1.4 Users can share files with other users.
1.5 Web-based user interface.

### 2. Security

2.1 Users can register, login, and logout.
2.2 Secured authentication process with password hashing, session/cookies, etc.
2.3 User input validations and protection against common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
2.4 Redirect users to the home screen or their last browsed location upon successful sign-in/logged in.

### 3. File Administration

3.1 Create folders.
3.2 Move files/folders.
3.3 Rename file/folder names.
3.4 Delete file(s)/folder(s).
3.5 Implement a Recycle Bin for deleted files.
3.6 Enable search functionality (free text, file types, etc.).
3.7 Allow users to sort their view.
3.8 Enable file versioning.

### 4. Error Handling & Logging

4.1 Display meaningful messages to users.
4.2 Record important events by logging them.

## Development Process

1. **Wireframe**: Create a visual representation of the application's user interface.

2. **UML**: Develop UML diagrams to represent the system's architecture and relationships.

3. **Database Schema**: Design a database schema supporting user accounts, file metadata, and folder hierarchy.

4. **Server APIs**: Design the APIs that will handle communication between the client and server.

5. **Testing**: Design unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies.

6. **Requirements Document and Issues**: Create a detailed requirements document and GitHub issues based on wireframes, UML, and database schema.

7. **Coding**: Start coding after wireframes, UML, and database schema are finalized.

8. **Git Team-Behavior**: Use Git issues for task tracking. Each team member should assign themselves to an issue and create a dedicated branch per issue, following a descriptive naming convention.

9. **PR and Issues Manager**: Appoint one team member to be the PR and Issues manager for a week. They will oversee pull requests and manage issues during that period.

**Note:** Follow the development process meticulously for a well-organized and efficient project workflow.
